# Salary Prediction using Decision Tree Regression

This project implements **Decision Tree Regression** to predict the salary of an employee based on their position level. By using a dataset containing position levels and their corresponding salaries, the project highlights how decision trees can capture complex relationships in data through non-linear regression. 

## Detailed Summary

The script starts by loading a dataset (`Position_Salaries.csv`) that contains employee position levels and their salaries. It trains a **Decision Tree Regressor** model using this data and makes predictions for unseen data points. The results are visualized to show how well the model fits the actual salary data.
